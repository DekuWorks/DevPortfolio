# 📁 Project & Portfolio – Application Development Fundamentals

Welcome to my official Portfolio 1 repository for **Application Development Fundamentals (ADF 156)** – my 7th course at Full Sail University.

This repo tracks research, development work, and progress through weekly milestones. It demonstrates my understanding of:

- 🔁 Git version control (Feature Branch Workflow)
- 📝 Markdown documentation
- 📂 Code organisation
- ✅ GitHub Issues, Project Boards & Milestones

## 🧠 Active Portfolio Work

I’m currently working on:
- [`241RunnersAwareness.org`](https://github.com/DekuWorks/241RunnersAwareness.org) – A web platform for public safety alerts
- [`PickyEaterApp`](https://github.com/DekuWorks/PickyEaterApp) – A nutrition-focused recipe planner (coming soon)

Both projects align with my degree path and expand my frontend/backend development experience.
