# 📁 Project & Portfolio – Application Development Fundamentals

> **Last updated:** July 12, 2025

Welcome to my official Portfolio 1 repository for **Application Development Fundamentals (ADF 156)** – my 7th course at Full Sail University.

This repo tracks research, development work, and progress through weekly milestones. It demonstrates my understanding of:

- 🔁 Git version control (Feature Branch Workflow)
- 📝 Markdown documentation
- 📂 Code organisation
- ✅ GitHub Issues, Project Boards & Milestones
