## Feature Branch Workflow in Git

**Description**  
I explored the feature branch workflow as introduced in ADF 156. This involved creating new branches off `main`, working on updates independently, and using pull requests to safely merge changes into the staging branch after review.

**Key Concepts Learned**
- Creating and naming feature branches (`git checkout -b feature/xyz`)
- Commit history and pull requests
- Merging branches to `stage` without affecting production

## Portfolio Updates using GitHub Projects

**Description**  
I reviewed how to use GitHub Projects and Milestones to manage open issues, prioritise tasks, and visualise workflow. I applied these tools to my live portfolio project (241RunnersAwareness.org) and created Milestone 5, linked to tasks from the 1-sheet guidance.

**Key Concepts Learned**
- Creating Issues and linking them to Projects and Milestones
- Using board columns: To Do / In Progress / Done
- Creating and closing Milestones based on work status
