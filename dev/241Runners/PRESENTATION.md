## üé• Demo Flow

### Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Test live application before presentation
- [ ] Prepare demo data (test accounts)
- [ ] Check internet connection
- [ ] Have backup screenshots ready
- [ ] Practice demo flow multiple times

### Demo Steps
1. **Open Browser**: Navigate to https://www.241runnersawareness.org
2. **Show Homepage**: Highlight design and mission
3. **Demo Registration**: Show signup process
4. **Demo Login**: Use test account
5. **Show Dashboard**: Demonstrate user features
6. **Show Admin Panel**: If admin account available

## üíª Code Snippets to Highlight

### Authentication Flow
```javascript
// React component showing login process
const LoginPage = () => {
  const [credentials, setCredentials] = useState({});
  
  const handleLogin = async () => {
    const response = await authService.login(credentials);
    if (response.success) {
      navigate('/dashboard');
    }
  };
};
```

### API Endpoint Example
```csharp
// ASP.NET Core controller
[HttpPost("login")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request)
{
    var user = await _authService.AuthenticateUser(request);
    if (user != null)
    {
        var token = _jwtService.GenerateToken(user);
        return Ok(new { token, user });
    }
    return Unauthorized();
}
```

### Database Migration
```csharp
// Entity Framework migration
public partial class AddUserAuthentication : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
            name: "Users",
            columns: table => new
            {
                Id = table.Column<int>(nullable: false)
                    .Annotation("SqlServer:Identity", "1, 1"),
                Email = table.Column<string>(maxLength: 100, nullable: false),
                PasswordHash = table.Column<string>(nullable: false),
                Role = table.Column<string>(maxLength: 20, nullable: false)
            });
    }
}
```
